# Interactive Retrieval Augmented Generation

This demo app uses [ActionWeaver](https://github.com/TengHu/ActionWeaver/tree/main) to organize and orchestrate tools/functions from [Llama Index](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) and [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) to implement an interactive RAG bot.

This demo app is not intended for use in production environments.

## Getting Started

To run the RAG application

```bash
streamlit run rag/app.py
```
Log information generated by the application will be appended to app.log.


This bot is designed to read and process content from both URLs and local files. It can answer questions based on the content it analyzes. If the bot is unable to provide an answer, it will initiate a Google search to find relevant information.

For a more in-depth understanding of how this bot works under the hood, please refer to the bot.py file. Additionally, you can explore the [ActionWeaver](https://github.com/TengHu/ActionWeaver/tree/main) repository for further details.
